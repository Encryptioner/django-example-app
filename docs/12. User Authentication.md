# User Authentication


## 1. **Setup clients sign up form**

- Create Client Apps
- Update `models.py` file to add `ClientUser` model
- Add `"clients.apps.ClientsConfig"` at `INSTALLED_APPS` in `mysite/settings.py`
- Run DB migration:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```
- Add `ClientUserSignupForm` in `forms.py`
- Create a `signup.html` file in templates directory of `clients` app
- Update `views.py` to add `signup_view`
- Update `urls.py` to support `signup` url
- Update `mysite/urls.py` to include `client urls`
```python
path("clients/", include("clients.urls")),
```

## 2. **Setup clients login handler**

- Create a `login.html` file in templates directory of `clients` app
- Update `signup.html` file to easy navigation to `login` page
- Update `views.py` to add `login_view`
- Also add a `logout_view` to logout user
- Add necessary urls in `urls.py` file


## 3. **Protect routes**

### Requirements

- One can, check the polls view only after login
- `Admin views` will be protected from `client user`
- `Polls views` will be protected from `admin user`
- When someone is `not logged`, if he visits the [base url](http://127.0.0.1:8000/), he will be redirected to `login` view
- When someone is `logged`, if he visits the [base url](http://127.0.0.1:8000/), he will be redirected to `polls index` view
- Update navigation menu to include a `logout` button. When clicked, user will be logged out
- If someone is `not logged`, he will see a `login` button in navigation, and `contact` and `logout` button will be hidden for him
- `Home` menu will point to `login view` for `logged out` user
- `Home` menu will point to `polls index View` for `logged in` user


### Implementation

- Add a `decorators.py` file in `clients app`, which will check if the user is authenticated or not. If authenticated, it will redirect user to `polls view`
- Add this `decorator` in `signup_view` and `login_view` to protect this routes for `logged in user`
- Add a `middleware.py` file in `clients app`, which will redirect `logged in user` to `polls view` when access the `/` url path
- Add this middleware in `MIDDLEWARE` section of `mysite/settings.py`
- Add a `middleware.py` file in `polls app`, which will redirect `non logged user` to `clients login view`
- Add this middleware in `MIDDLEWARE` section of `mysite/settings.py`
- Check `mysite/urls.py` file. Add a new path there
```python
path("", home_view, name="home")
```
- The `home_view` will check user's authentication and redirect to necessary route
```python
def home_view(request):
  if request.user.is_authenticated:
      return redirect("/polls/")
  return redirect("/clients/login/")
```
- Update navigation in `polls/base.html` file to conditionally show navigation menus
- Create a `mysite/middleware.py` file which will check the `user authentication` and see if it is an instance of `admin user` or `client` user
   - If `Client user`, it will redirect user to `polls index view`
   - If `Admin user`, it will redirect user to `default admin view`
- Add this middleware in `MIDDLEWARE` in `mysite/settings.py` file
- Add further permission validation in `models.py` of `clients app` to protect access to admin views. It overwrite `AbstractUser` class, to ensure no permission is provided to view admin side from client user.


## 4. **Update authentication**

- Add a `auth_backends.py` file in `clients app`. It will act as a authentication backend for client side users
- Update `mysite/settings.py` file to include authentication backends. We will have two backends now. One for `client user` another for `admin user`. Default `AUTH_USER_MODEL` will be `auth.User`
```python
AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = [
    "clients.auth_backends.ClientUserBackend",  # Custom backend for client users
    "django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend",  # Default backend for admin
]
```
-  Update `home_view` and `login_view` of `clients app` to specify which backend should be considered when login from client side
