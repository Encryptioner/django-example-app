# Starter Tutorial - 5

## Customize the admin form
1. You can customize the admin side as ur need
2. Reordering the fields
   - update fields before registering the question model
   - For admin forms with dozens of fields, choosing an intuitive order is good `User Experience (UX)` 
3. Adding related objects
   - “Choices” is an available option in the Django admin
   - U can add `choice` for a question. Django shows the `question` as selection option considering the `ForeignKey` of the choice model
   - Though, in reality, it is not a convenient way to add choice for a question

## Add choice from question in better way
