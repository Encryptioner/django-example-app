## Debugging Django App

### Installing Django Debug Toolbar
1. You can install by;
```
python -m pip install django-debug-toolbar
```
2. The better way is using `requirements.in` and `requirements.txt` file. It ensures, the versions of python packages are documented and easy to share

### Integrate the django-debug-toolbar with the project
1. Add `debug_toolbar` to your INSTALLED_APPS in `mysite/setting.py`
2. Add `django-debug-toolbar’s` URLs to your project’s URLconf `mysite/urls.py`
3. Add `debug_toolbar.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware` to your MIDDLEWARE in `mysite/setting.py`
4. The order of `MIDDLEWARE` is important. You should include the Debug Toolbar middleware as early as possible in the list. However, it must come after any other middleware that encodes the response’s content, such as `GZipMiddleware`
5. The Debug Toolbar is shown only if your IP address is listed in Django’s `INTERNAL_IPS` setting. This means that for local development, you must add `127.0.0.1` to `INTERNAL_IPS`


### Using django-debug-toolbar
1. Once installed, you should be able to see the DjDT “handle” on the right side of the browser window when you browse to `http://localhost:8000/admin/`
2. Click it to open the debug toolbar and use the tools in each panel
