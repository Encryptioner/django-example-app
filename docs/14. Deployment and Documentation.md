# Deployment and Documentation

After development, it is necessary to deploy the project for real-world usage, and preparing detailed documentation to ensure smooth handoff and scalability.

---

## 1. **Deploying the Project**

Deployment is the process of making your application available to real-world users.

### Preparing for Deployment
#### Production Settings
Update `settings.py` for production:
```python
DEBUG = False
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['yourdomain.com']

# Use secure settings
SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True
CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True
```

#### Static Files
Collect static files for serving in production:
```bash
python manage.py collectstatic
```

### Deployment Options
#### Deploying with Gunicorn and Nginx
1. Install Gunicorn and Nginx:
   ```bash
   pip install gunicorn
   sudo apt install nginx
   ```
2. Run Gunicorn:
   ```bash
   gunicorn your_project_name.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:8000
   ```
3. Configure Nginx:
   Create a file `/etc/nginx/sites-available/your_project`:
   ```nginx
   server {
       server_name yourdomain.com;
       location /static/ {
           root /path/to/your/project;
       }
       location / {
           proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
       }
   }
   ```
   Enable the configuration:
   ```bash
   sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/your_project /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```
4. It is often necessary to run multiple python project to run from same production server. In that case, create virtual environment and install packages as described earlier.
   - Create `Gunicorn` Systemd Service File for Each Project. For this, create a service file under `/etc/systemd/system/`. For example:
    ```ini
    [Unit]
    Description=Gunicorn instance for Project1
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    User=your_user
    Group=your_group
    WorkingDirectory=/path/to/project1
    ExecStart=/path/to/project1/venv/bin/gunicorn --workers 3 --bind unix:/path/to/project1/project1.sock project1.wsgi:application

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```
    - Start and enable the service:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start project1
    sudo systemctl enable project1
    ```
    - Repeat this for `project2` and other projects.


#### Deploying to Cloud Services
- **Heroku**:
  1. Install Heroku CLI:
     ```bash
     curl https://cli-assets.heroku.com/install.sh | sh
     ```
  2. Push to Heroku:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Prepare for deployment"
     git push heroku main
     ```
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**:
  Use AWS EB CLI for deploying your project.

#### Containerization with Docker
1. Create a `Dockerfile`:
   ```dockerfile
   FROM python:3.10
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY . .
   RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
   CMD ["gunicorn", "your_project_name.wsgi:application", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8000"]
   ```
2. Build and run the container:
   ```bash
   docker build -t your_project .
   docker run -p 8000:8000 your_project
   ```

#### Secure the Server
- Use **TLS/SSL Certificates**:
  Install Let's Encrypt for HTTPS:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
  sudo certbot --nginx
  ```

- Set appropriate file permissions for each project.

---

## 2. **Preparing Documentation**

Comprehensive documentation helps maintain and scale the project.

### Technical Documentation
#### Codebase Overview
Explain the structure of the project:
```
your_project/
│
├── your_app/
│   ├── migrations/
│   ├── templates/
│   └── views.py
│
├── static/
├── media/
├── manage.py
└── requirements.txt
```

#### API Documentation
Document available endpoints and their functionality:
```json
POST /clients/signup/ - Sign up a user
POST /clients/login/ - Logs a user after password validation
GET /clients/logout/ - Logout a user

GET /polls/ - Retrieve all polls question
GET /polls/<id>/ - Retrieve a single poll question
GET /polls/<id>/results/ - Retrieve poll result for a single question
```

#### Deployment Instructions
Provide step-by-step instructions for deploying the application, including prerequisites and commands.

### User Documentation
Include:
- **Getting Started**: Instructions for users to navigate and use the application.
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and their solutions.

### Tools for Documentation
- **Markdown**: Use Markdown files for README and codebase documentation.
- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: For API documentation.
- **Sphinx**: For generating technical documentation.

---

## 3. **Final Checks Before Handoff**
- **Run all tests** to ensure there are no regressions.
- **Ensure all endpoints are functional**.
- **Verify deployment** on the production server.

By finalizing testing, deploying effectively, and preparing detailed documentation, your Django project will be ready for real-world usage with maintainable, user-friendly practices.
