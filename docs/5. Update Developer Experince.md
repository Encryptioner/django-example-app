# Update Developer Experience (DX)

## What is DX

Developer experience refers to the experience developers have in an environment where software development occurs and the level of complexity that allows them to turn ideas into usable and useful applications. It incorporates the feelings that a developer derives from working within an organization.

### Core Components of DevEx
1. Tools and infrastructure:
2. Documentation and resources
3. Streamlined code review.
4. Team and system processes
5. Clear ownership structure and support.
