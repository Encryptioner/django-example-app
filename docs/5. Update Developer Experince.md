# Update Developer Experience (DX)

## What is DX

Developer experience refers to the experience developers have in an environment where software development occurs and the level of complexity that allows them to turn ideas into usable and useful applications. It incorporates the feelings that a developer derives from working within an organization.

### Core Components of DX
1. Tools and infrastructure:
2. Documentation and resources
3. Streamlined code review.
4. Team and system processes
5. Clear ownership structure and support.

### Linting
Linting is important to reduce errors and improve the overall quality of your code. The process of linting, aided by lint tools, can keep source code consistent and improve code review.

### Linting in Python
- There are different linter for python. For example: `PyLint`, `flake8`, `mypy`, `Ruff` etc.
- Linting helps organizing python code and visualize better

### Auto Formatting in Python
- There are different formatter for python which formats the code according to linting suggestion. For example: `autopep8`, `Black`, `yapf`, `Ruff` etc.
- Auto formatter can run on code save or by specific command
- Formatting helps organizing python code effortlessly
