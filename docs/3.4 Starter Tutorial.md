# Starter Tutorial - 4

## Writing Minimal Form
1. Update `details` view in polls app to include a html form
2. It will show the question choices in `radio` button
3. User can select the radio button to select a choice
4. On submit, `polls:vote` url will be called which will send the choice to backend of our app
5. `{% csrf_token %}` will be used in form which ensures no [Cross Site Request Forgery]((https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf)). This is automatically supported by django

## Update views to handle vote
1. Use `request.POST['choice']` to get the selected choices
2. If choice is not selected, show `KeyError` and re-display form with error message
3. Otherwise, update the votes
4. Redirect to different page so that, user doesn't give submit the form again
