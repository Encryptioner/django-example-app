# Starter Tutorial - 4

## Writing Minimal Form
1. Update `details` view in polls app to include a html form
2. It will show the question choices in `radio` button
3. User can select the radio button to select a choice
4. On submit, `polls:vote` url will be called which will send the choice to backend of our app
5. `{% csrf_token %}` will be used in form which ensures no [Cross Site Request Forgery]((https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf)). This is automatically supported by django

## Update views to handle vote
1. Use `request.POST['choice']` to get the selected choices
2. If choice is not selected, show `KeyError` and re-display form with error message
3. Otherwise, update the votes
4. Redirect to different page so that, user doesn't give submit the form again
5. `reverse()` function in the `HttpResponseRedirect` is used to avoid having to hardcode a URL in the view function

## Show Vote Result
1. Get `question` from database
2. Show that question info including voting results in `results.html` file

## Concept of Generic Views
1. For similar & generic case for showing data in web development, Django provides shortcut.
2. For example, `ListView` and `DetailView` generic views abstract the concepts of “display a list of objects” and “display a detail page for a particular type of object” respectively.

## Using Generic Views
1. Convert the URLconf
   - Update `urls.py` of `polls` app, to use generic view
   - the name of the matched pattern in the path strings of the second and  third patterns has changed from `<question_id>` to `<pk>`
   - For generic view, it expects the primary key value captured from the URL to be called `pk`
2. Update view to use generic view
   - Remove our old `index`, `detail`, and `results` views
   - By default, the `DetailView` generic view uses a template called `<app name>/<model name>_detail.html`
   - Similarly, the `ListView` generic view uses a default template called `<app name>/<model name>_list.html`; we use template_name to tell ListView to use our existing `polls/index.html` template.
