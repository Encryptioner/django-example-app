# Starter Tutorial - Admin Form

## Admin Form Customization

### Customize the admin form
1. You can customize the admin side as ur need
2. Reordering the fields
   - update fields before registering the question model
   - For admin forms with dozens of fields, choosing an intuitive order is good `User Experience (UX)`
3. Adding related objects
   - “Choices” is an available option in the Django admin
   - U can add `choice` for a question. Django shows the `question` as selection option considering the `ForeignKey` of the choice model
   - Though, in reality, it is not a convenient way to add choice for a question

### Add choice from question in better way
1. Update `QuestionAdmin` in `admin.py` to include choices in question form
2. Check `Add Question` in `admin` side to visualize the changes
3. Use `TabularInline` instead of `StackedInline`, related choices for question will be shown in tabular form

### Customize the `Select question to change` list
1. By default, Django displays the `str()` of each object. But sometimes it’d be more helpful if we could display individual fields
2. Use the `list_display` admin option, which is a list of field names to display, as columns, on the change list page for the object
3. Check the page to visualize the changes
4. You can click on the column headers to sort by those values – except in the case of the `was_published_recently` header
5. You can improve that by using the `display()` decorator on that method (extending the polls/models.py file)
6. Edit your `polls/admin.py` file again and add an improvement to the Question change list page: filters using the `list_filter`.
7. That adds a `Filter` sidebar that lets people filter the change list by the pub_date field
8. The type of filter displayed depends on the type of field you're filtering on. Because `pub_date` is a `DateTimeField`, Django knows to give appropriate filter options: “Any date”, “Today”, “Past 7 days”, “This month”, “This year”.
9. You can add search capability by adding `search_fields = ["question_text"]`
10. Note that change lists give you free `pagination`. The default is to display `100` items per page.
