# Update User Interface (UI & UX)

## What is UI & UX
Creating websites and apps is an elaborate process for web developers, but it’s not a solo job: designers are also needed to create user-friendly interfaces that help the user find what they’re looking for. User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) design are critical components of web development. UX focuses on the overall feel of the product, while UI focuses on the look and layout.

Developer needs to have good understanding of UI & UX. So, he can co-operate with all the stake holders of the project to deliver a website which looks good, feels great to use.

### Updating Style
1. You can use some third party css library to for your project which can update styles to standard format
2. Include that style's link in `html head`

### Using a base html file and extend it
1. Create a file named `base.html` file in `polls/templates/polls` directory
2. Extract the main header and body part of the index file
3. Keep a `block` portion inside `base.html` file. Wherever extended, this portion will be used to place the content of the extended file
```
{% block content %}
{% endblock %}
```
4. In the `index.html` file, extend the `polls/base.html` file
```
{% extends 'polls/base.html' %}
```
5. Now place the block code which you need to be placed inside the `block placeholder` of `base.html` file.
```
{% block content %}
    # unique template code block of that file
{% endblock %}
```
6. Similarly, you can extend html wherever necessary
