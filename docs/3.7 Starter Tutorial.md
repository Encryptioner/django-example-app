# Starter Tutorial - 7

## Customize the app's look and feel

### Add Static Styles
1. Create a directory called `static` in your `polls` directory.
2. Within the `static` directory you have just created, create another directory called `polls`
3. Within that create a file called `style.css`
4. Update the styles as you need
5. Update the `polls/templates/polls/index.html` by adding below at top of file
```bash
{% load static %}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'polls/style.css' %}">
```
6. Restart the server by running `python manage.py runserver`

### Add Background Image
1. Create an images subdirectory in the `polls/static/polls/` directory
2. Inside this directory, add any image file that youâ€™d like to use as a background.
3. Add a reference to your image in your stylesheet (`polls/static/polls/style.css`):
```bash
background: white url("images/background.avif") no-repeat;
background-size: cover;
```
