# Contact View - Admin Side

## Making Contact Information Viewable in the Django Admin

### Step 1: Register the Model in the Admin

Add the `Contact` model to the Django admin interface.

```python
# admin.py
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Contact

class ContactAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ('name', 'email', 'submitted_at')
    list_filter = ('submitted_at',)
    search_fields = ('name', 'email', 'message')

admin.site.register(Contact, ContactAdmin)
```

### Step 2: Access the Admin Panel

1. Start the Django development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. Log in to the admin panel at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`.

3. Locate the "Contacts" section and click to view the submitted contact information.

To allow the admin to view the uploaded file in the Django admin interface, you can customize the admin configuration to include a clickable link to the uploaded file. Hereâ€™s how you can achieve this:

## Steps to Display Uploaded Files in the Admin

### Step 1: Modify the Admin Configuration

Update the `ContactAdmin` class in `admin.py` to display a clickable link for the uploaded file. Use the `admin_display` decorator to create a custom column.

```python
# admin.py
from django.contrib import admin
from django.utils.html import format_html
from .models import Contact

class ContactAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ('name', 'email', 'submitted_at', 'uploaded_file_link')
    list_filter = ('submitted_at',)
    search_fields = ('name', 'email', 'message')

    @admin.display(description='Uploaded File')
    def uploaded_file_link(self, obj):
        if obj.file:
            return format_html('<a href="{}" target="_blank">View File</a>', obj.file.url)
        return "No file uploaded"
```

### Explanation

- **`format_html`**: Safely generates HTML for the admin interface. This ensures the link to the uploaded file is displayed securely.
- **`obj.file.url`**: Provides the URL to the uploaded file. Django automatically resolves the file path using the `MEDIA_URL` configuration.
- **`if obj.file`**: Ensures that the link is only displayed if a file was uploaded.

### Step 2: Serve Media Files During Development

Update `urls.py` of `mysite` directory to serve media files when running the development server.

```python
# urls.py
from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static

urlpatterns = [
    # Your other URL patterns
] + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
```

---

### Step 3: Restart the Development Server
If you've made changes to urls.py or settings.py, restart the server to apply the changes:

```bash
Copy code
python manage.py runserver
```

### Step 4: Test the Admin Interface

1. Log in to the Django admin panel.
2. Navigate to the "Contacts" section.
3. View the "Uploaded File" column in the list view.
   - If a file is uploaded, a clickable link labeled "View File" will be shown.
   - If no file is uploaded, the column will display "No file uploaded."

## Example of Admin Display

| **Name**       | **Email**          | **Submitted At**       | **Uploaded File**    |
|-----------------|--------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| John Doe        | john@example.com   | 2024-12-22 10:00:00    | [View File](#)       |
| Jane Smith      | jane@example.com   | 2024-12-22 10:05:00    | No file uploaded     |

---

This setup ensures that the admin can view uploaded files directly from the admin interface, making it convenient to manage and verify submissions.
