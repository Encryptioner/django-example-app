   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install python3-tk
   ```
### **MAC**

brew install python-tk
   ```


2. **Verify Installation**:
   Run the following command:
   ```bash
   python3 -m tkinter
   ```
   If Tkinter is installed, a small test window will appear.

3. **Common Issues**:
   - **Multiple Python Versions**:
     If you have multiple Python versions installed, ensure Tkinter is installed for the correct version:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install python3.10-tk  # Replace '3.10' with your Python version
     ```
   - **Virtual Environment Access**:
     When using virtual environments, create them with access to system packages:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv --system-site-packages
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

     ```cmd
     python -m tkinter
     ```

2. **Install Tkinter**:
   If Tkinter is not installed, reinstall Python with Tcl/Tk support:
